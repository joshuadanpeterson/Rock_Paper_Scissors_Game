# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a basic implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. You can play against the computer, which makes random choices using the built-in `random` module.

## How to Play

2. Follow the prompts to choose either "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
3. The computer will also make a random choice.
4. The winner of each round is determined by the game's rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
5. After each round, the scores of both the player and the computer will be displayed.
6. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (The script is compatible with Python 3)

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
